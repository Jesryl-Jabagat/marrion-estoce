                        <p>The Filipino choreographer Claire Casalhay revisited the roots of ballet; both made Filipino ballet a contemporary, experimental, and philosophical art.
                         Neither was afraid to cross boundaries and test the traditions of ballet. 
                         Like all great choreographers she also did some choreography that has been known by many people across the Philippines.</p>
